Data Types in the Go progamming Laguage

There are four distinct types in Go namely:
    1. Baic types
    2. Reference types
    3. Aggregate types
    4. Interface types
    


Integers
They are under the basic types in Go.
We can either use signed or unsigned integers within our program and we can specify the size of integer we need.
We can create new integer variables by typing either uint or int with the size of the int appended to the end.


  // unsigned int with 8 bits
  // Can store: 0 to 255
  var myint uint8
  
  // signed int with 8 bits
  // Can store: -127 to 127
  var myint int8

  // unsigned int with 16 bits
  var myint uint16
  
  // signed int with 16 bits
  var myint int16

  // unsigned int with 32 bits
  var myint uint32
  
  // signed int with 32 bits
  var myint int32

  // unsigned int with 64 bits
  var myint uint64
  
  // signed int with 64 bits
  var myint int64
